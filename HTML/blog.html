                    "When our family arrived in Charlotte, North Carolina for the Meet and Greet on that Wednesday evening, we were all very impressed with Verita and her staff. They would not allow us to lift a finger; they served us and cleared away our dishes. Our families and guests were simply in awe of her presentation. Her love and passion was displayed as she presented us with three breathtaking displays of visual and culinary art. The arrangements were spectacular and the food superb. When we thought it could not get any better, the location for the Saturday banquet was absolutely exquisite from the hallway to the banquet hall with bright and colorful floral arrangements and special lighting. Everything was done to perfection. <br><br> Verita and her staffwere the epitome of professionalism and elegance from the way they dressed to the way they served our family. Her presentation ofthe food was outstanding and the food tasted just as good as it looked. Although we were a small group of nearly 90 people, Verita and her staff treated us as if we were royalty."

I don't know if I really have the words to honestly express how sincerely appreciative my family is for the superb job you and your team provided for us during my daughters wedding reception. I along with my guest expressed the same look of amazement as we took in the beautiful splendor of the entire room that you transformed. Everyone that knows me can attest I am not an emotional person. FYI I did not tear up at any part of my daughters beautiful wedding ceremony, however when I walked in to the reception and saw your breath taking creation I was moved to tears. <br><br>Eloquent Creations went above and beyond our expectations. About the food OMG that's the first expression everybody says. It was delicious and beautifully presented. It was the main topic of conversation during the evening. Everybody said it was the best food they ever had at any reception or gala. You and your entire team displayed such a eloquent air of professionalism, not only in your manner but your attire also. Your name really speaks of who you are. The personal touches you added and your entire vision were truly amazing. Its plain to see that you love what you do, and it shows. God has blessed you with a gift and you are blessing others with what you do. Thank You and I Know you will always be a Leader in your Profession."

Ms. Elliott and her staff are always impressive in their attire. They are courteous and personable when attending to their clients and are always on time. Ms. Elliott makes the atmosphere of her jobs conducive to good conversation and enjoyment of the food. The food she serves is delicious and served at the appropriate temperature. Her desserts, especially, are always praised. From wedding receptions to Board of Directors luncheons and meetings to exhibit openings and receptions, I have always been satisfied and impressed with the services Ms. Elliott provides and wholeheartedly recommend Eloquent Creations for any catering work they may pursue."

                    "Remembering my experience working for Ms. Elliott (the way the guests felt, the food and the atmosphere) prompted me to use her services for my company's Service Awards Ceremony. Ms. Elliott and her team did not disappoint our 200 guests and honorees. Her team arrived at the venue well in advance, decorated the serving tables and adding special touches throughout. Ms. Elliott and her staff were professional, courteous, and attentive to our needs. <br><br>One special moment that stood out for me at the event was when Ms. Elliott recognized that those of us hosting had not had the opportunity to eat with everyone else. She personally served us when the event was over, requiring us to sitdown and enjoy dinner. <br><br>As a hospital leader, I am often reminded of a quote by Maya Angelou that I share with my employees, 'I've learned that people will forget what you said, people will forget what you did, but people will never fOlget how you made them feel.' <br><br>It was this simple act that made us feel special and I will not hesitate use her services for future events."
